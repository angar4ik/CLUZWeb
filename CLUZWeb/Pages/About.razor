        This small web application is my implementation of social game Mafia which have one important benefit,
        to play you don't need a host.
        Mafia (also known as The Werewolves) is a social deduction game, created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986.
        The game models a conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the mafiosi or the werewolves),
        and an uninformed majority (the villagers). At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned
        a role affiliated with one of these teams. The game has two alternating phases: first, a night role,
        during which those with night killing powers may covertly kill other players, and second, a day role,
        in which surviving players debate the identities of players and vote to eliminate a suspect. The game
        continues until a faction achieves its win condition; for the village, this usually means eliminating the
        evil minority, while for the minority this usually means reaching numerical parity with the village and
        eliminating any rival evil groups. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">More</a>
